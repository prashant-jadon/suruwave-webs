    <h1>Privacy Policy for Suruwave</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 07 Nov 2024</p>

    <p>At <strong>Suruwave</strong>, operated by <strong>Chandra Apps</strong>, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting any personal information you may provide. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our app.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Since <strong>Suruwave</strong> offers anonymous sign-in via Google Firebase, we collect minimal information as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Anonymous Authentication Data:</strong> We use Google Firebase Anonymous Authentication, which may store a unique identifier to enable access without needing personal information like your name, email address, or phone number.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect data on how the app is accessed and used, including device type, operating system, time and date of usage, and other diagnostic data. This information helps us improve our services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The data we collect is used solely to provide and improve the <strong>Suruwave</strong> experience. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>App Functionality:</strong> To enable anonymous access and manage content availability.</li>
        <li><strong>App Improvement:</strong> To understand app usage patterns, identify potential issues, and improve user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> <strong>Suruwave</strong> data is stored using Google Firebase, which maintains secure infrastructure and complies with industry standards for data protection.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Measures:</strong> We use commercially acceptable means to protect your data. However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p><strong>Suruwave</strong> relies on third-party services (Google Firebase) for authentication and data storage. By using <strong>Suruwave</strong>, you agree to Google Firebaseâ€™s data handling practices as outlined in their <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Anonymous user data and usage data are retained only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy. We may retain this data for internal analysis, to strengthen the app's functionality and security.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p><strong>Suruwave</strong> is intended for users aged 13 and above. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware of such information being collected without parental consent, we will delete it promptly.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices. We will notify users of any significant changes by updating the "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of <strong>Suruwave</strong> after any changes indicates acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
